# Astigmatism

A script I wrote to emulate a light trails effect in Adobe After Effects.

## Description

Inspired by Max Cooper's Resynthesis [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpm1l0HfkV0), I wanted to emulate the light trails effect which is featured throughtout the video. I noticed the effect was pretty similar to what people with [astigmatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism) see, thus I decided to name the project "Astigmatism". Although I've written the script that is needed to emulate the effect, you will need a solid understanding of Adobe After Effects in order to follow up, since a good part of achieving the effect is to experiment with the layers.
